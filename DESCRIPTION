Description: This package contains functions to process and analyze data exported from the Fulcrum applications "Nematode Field Sampling" and "Nematode Isolation". These appications are maintained by the Andersen Lab and permission must be granted to export the data. The Nematode Field Sampling app facilitates the sampling of nematodes from nature by offering an easy-to-use interface to record data on substrate, temperature, humidity, and other ecological parameters. The app gives investigators the ability to pair these data with GPS position and photographic evidence at the sampling site. Once nematodes are sampled from nature, the companion application called "Nematode Isolation” is used to record data generated during the isolation process. The primary function of the easyfulcrum package is to match isolation records back to the field sampling records. It also implements diagnostic reporting to review trends in collection data and alert investigators of potential errors within a collection.
